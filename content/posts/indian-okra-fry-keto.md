## Step-by-Step Method

### 1) Prep the okra (2-3 min)
- Wash okra thoroughly and pat completely dry (moisture makes okra slimy)
- Trim the ends and slice into ¬Ω-inch rounds
- **Pro tip:** Make sure okra is completely dry before cooking

### 2) Heat the fat blend (1 min)
- Heat butter and coconut oil together in a medium pan over medium heat
- **Why this combo?** Coconut oil prevents butter from burning at higher temps while keeping that rich flavor

### 3) Aromatics first (2-3 min)
- Add cumin seeds - let them sizzle for 10-15 seconds
- Add curry leaves (they'll splutter - be careful!)
- Add minced garlic and sliced onion
- Saut√© until onion turns light golden brown and garlic is fragrant

### 4) Spice it up (30 sec)
- Add turmeric and a pinch of salt
- Stir quickly to coat the aromatics
- **Important:** Don't let turmeric burn - it gets bitter

### 5) Add the okra (8-10 min)
- Add all the okra pieces to the pan
- **Key technique:** Don't stir immediately - let them sit for 1-2 minutes to start browning
- Then stir gently every 2-3 minutes
- Cook until okra is tender and slightly crispy on edges

### 6) Final seasoning (1 min)
- Add red chili powder and black pepper
- Toss everything together for final 30-60 seconds
- Taste and adjust salt

### 7) Serve hot
- Best enjoyed immediately while crispy
- Perfect alongside any Indian keto main dish or as a snack
