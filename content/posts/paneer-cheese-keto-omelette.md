## Step-by-Step with Cues

### 1) Prep (1–2 min)

- Crack 2 eggs into a bowl. Add a small pinch of salt and pepper.
- **Why now?** A tiny bit of salt helps the eggs blend; don't over-salt yet because the cheese is salty.
- Cube/crumb paneer (small pieces melt into the omelette better).
- If using spinach/chilli, chop them now.
- Have cheese ready in a small bowl—you'll need it fast later.

### 2) Heat the pan (30–45 sec)

- Place pan on medium heat (on a 1–10 dial, think 5–6).
- Add 1 tbsp butter/ghee.
- **Cues:** it should melt and just start to shimmer. If it smokes, your pan is too hot—lower the heat.

### 3) Quick sauté: paneer + spices (1–2 min)

- Add paneer to the hot fat. Stir so every piece gets coated.
- Sprinkle turmeric, chilli powder, cumin, garam masala.
- If using, add chopped chilli and spinach now.
- **Cues:** you'll smell the spices bloom, paneer gets lightly golden on the edges, spinach wilts.
- Season lightly with salt.
- **Important:** Don't let spices burn—if they look dry, lower heat a notch and add ½ tsp more butter.
- Scrape the mixture out to a plate. Keep pan on the stove.

### 4) Eggs into pan (0–30 sec)

- Drop heat to low-medium (dial 3–4). If the pan looks dry, add a tiny pat of butter back in.
- Whisk eggs for 5–10 seconds (just until uniform).
- Pour eggs into the center of the pan and tilt so they cover the surface.

### 5) Set the base (45–90 sec)

- Let the eggs sit 10–15 sec undisturbed so the bottom starts to set.
- Use your spatula to gently lift an edge of the omelette while you tilt the pan, letting the still-runny egg flow underneath.
- Do this around the pan 2–3 times.
- **Cues:** the top should be glossy but not watery; you should be able to slide the spatula under the center without tearing.

### 6) Fill & fold (45–60 sec)

- Sprinkle the sautéed paneer mix evenly over one half of the omelette.
- Add shredded cheese on top of the paneer.
- Using the spatula, fold the empty half over the filled half—think half-moon.
- Press very gently to help the cheese contact the heat and melt.

### 7) Finish (30–45 sec)

- Keep on low-medium. Cook another 30–45 sec, then flip the half-moon once (optional) for 15–20 sec to melt the cheese through.
- **Cues:** outside is pale yellow with maybe light golden spots, not browned all over (browning = tougher eggs).
- Slide to a plate. Rest 30 sec (carryover heat finishes the melt). Garnish with coriander if you like.
